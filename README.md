# antisocial
A (parody) social media site built around being the opposite of a social media site (anti-social).

## ideas
* instead of encouraging following and connecting with more people, the site encourages you to dis-associate with people through recommendations (you haven't DM'd this person in awhile, perhaps you should drop them from your friends list).
* Categories: Stranger, Acquaintance, Friend
* The site encourages continuous building of the close relationships you already have (you haven't played Minecraft with Drake in a while, perhaps you should join his server for 2 hours)
* There's a main public board for everyone to post whatever, but instead of their usernames everyone you don't know is called 'Stranger'. And there's a red warning label under or above their content: "Stranger Danger: Can you really trust what this person is saying?"
* The site also alerts you to when your friends have reported having a bad or off day: "Sally has reported feeling 10% sadder this week. Perhaps take her out for coffee for some 1 on 1 decompress time"
* Of course the above means quizzes/questions are given at certain intervals. 
* Apparently the site recommends very specific actions based on the friendship/person
* Extra: Have the site be able to follow your friends around the interwebs: see Drake's steam activity, Sally's Facebook usage time, Darren's Discord activity, Raru's LinkedIn work status
